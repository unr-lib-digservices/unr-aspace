Handwritten on verso: These are bad views of the head but they give an idea of the general contour and the bronze will be a big help. There is something wrong but to fix it was beyond me at the time &amp; now too late. The collar is wrong but I am working on the height to cover it. Photograph taken by Riverside Studio. </p>
